### NOAH Landslide Hazard Maps

# Description:
The DOST project under Project NOAH is entitled Enhancing Philippine Landslide Hazard Maps with LiDAR and High Resolution Imageries. The project aims to map landslide susceptibility using 1-meter resolution LiDAR and 5-meter resolution IfSAR-derived Digital Elevation Model data. Landslide hazards are merged outputs from three landslide models: Matterocking and Conefall for unstable slopes and runout zones of structurally controlled landslides, SINMAP (Stability Index Mapping) for shallow landslides, and Flow-R for debris flows. Conefall runout extents are classified as high-hazard areas and are equivalent to SINMAP areas with 1.0 ≥ SI ≥ 0. Similarly, Flow-R debris flow extents are classified as high hazard. Low to medium-hazard areas are clipped when merging landslide hazard maps with debris flow extents to make sure that they do not overlap with the high-hazard debris flow extent.
