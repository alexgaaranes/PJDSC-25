### NOAH Flood Hazard Maps

# Description:
The 100-year rain return flood hazard maps show low (Var=1), medium (Var=2), and high (Var=3) flood hazards represented as
yellow, orange, and red respectively. Flood hazards consider take both the height and velocity of the water
into consideration and calculates the hazard levels based on the danger they pose to people and
structures. Generally, for an average Filipino with a height of 5’ 6”, areas with flood depths from the knee
down can be considered to have low hazard levels. Those with flood depths ranging from the knee to neck
are considered to have medium hazard levels, and those covered with floods that are higher than the neck
have high hazard levels. However, since the flow velocity is also considered, areas that have shallow but
fast-flowing flood waters may have a higher hazard level than that denoted by the height of the flood
covering it.
